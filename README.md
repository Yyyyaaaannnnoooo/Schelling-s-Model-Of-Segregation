<h1>Schelling's Model of Segregation <a href="https://Yyyyaaaannnnoooo.github.io/Schelling-s-Model-Of-Segregation/">Web APP</a></h1>
This web application takes the studies made by the economist Thomas Schelling, and translates them to an interactive model to be used in the browser.
<h2>How it works</h2>
The application works with the same rules given for the "Schelling's Model of Segregation". You can think of the square nearby as a city. Each polygon represents a single citizen, that from now on we will call agent, the number of edges its social status. Each agent has a tolerance, at the beginning it is set to 30%, this means that the agent will feel confortable if at least 30% of his neighbours have his same social status. The neighbours are the 8 other agents sorrounding each agent.
